**I am a Network Automation Enthusiast, saving the world one network automation at a time**

I spent the first 20 years of my professional life as a restaurant kitchen manager.  I went back to college at the age of 34 and obtained a Master's degree in Cybersecurity in 3.5 years.  I landed as a Senior Network Engineer at NASA for almost 7 years before pivoting into a Senior Network DevOps Engineer role.  I am a self taught coder and an innovative network automation geek of the higest order.

With a strong focus on **automation innovation**, I thrive on building high-performing automation workflows and delivering scalable, innovative solutions that drive real impact. My passion lies in **customer experience** and **network automation**, where I turn complex challenges into opportunities for growth.

ðŸ“– Network engineer turned Network DevOps engineer through necessity and love of coding.

ðŸ”­ Leading teams on transformative projects to reshape industries.

ðŸŒ± Continuously learning and empowering others through mentorship and collaboration.

ðŸš€ Dedicated to pushing the boundaries of technology while fostering a culture of excellence.
